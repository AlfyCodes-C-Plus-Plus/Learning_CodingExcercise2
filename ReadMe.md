# Coding Exercise 2

In this exercise you will write a statement using cout and the insertion operator << to display how many dogs Sally has.

The variable x represents the number of dogs

x has already been declared and initialized for you

The output should read "Sally has 3 dogs".

For this exercise there is NO need to use the '\n' character or endl to create a new line after the output statement

Note: Only a single cout statement is required for this exercise. No other code should be necessary.
